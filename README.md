# Overview


This app is used to collect recipes. A user can input a recipie name and the ingredients, and then can later search for that information.

I created this app because I personally like to bake, but I can never remember where I found a recipe. If I put my favorite recipes into an app, then I can spend less time searching.



# Development Environment

I developed this program in the Android Studio development IDE.

This project was coded in Kotlin, and utilized Compose structures that are a part of Android Studio.

# Future Work

* I can store the recipes, but not display them.
* I can work on making the display look more appealing.
* I can try to integrate a database instead of a list.
